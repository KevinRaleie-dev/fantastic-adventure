# Building a social fashion marketplace platform. 👢

This is the backend of said platform (which i dont have a name for yet), but you can find the
frontend of the application [here](https://github.com/KevinRaleie-dev/ecom-client-react). I'm going solo dolo on this one✌🏽😭 but this is a project i've always wanted to build and yeah, i wont say much about it at this point but i will keep some branches open of features i build to this backend as well as the frontend, in case anybody's peeping and they tryna learn but also for my own sanity as well🤫.

* Might build a react native app for this as well 🤞🏽 *

## The Stack 👨🏽‍💻

I went with the PERN + GraphQL stack on this simply because im familiar with it.

    * PostgreSQL, Redis
    * Node / Express with TypeScript
    * React on the frontend
    * GraphQL
    * TypeORM 
    * TypeGraphQL
    * ApolloServer
